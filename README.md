# Soil water potential and modelling of unsaturated soil water dynamics

This is a collection of one example script (jupyter notebook 1D_Richards_Experiment.ipynb) and a lecture note (potenzial_ungesaettigte_bodenwasserdynamik.pdf) teaching soil water potentials and introducing the modelling of water dynamics in unsaturated soils (in German).
